Changes in version 1.23:

A bug has been fixed that sometimes marked the wrong block as
non-scraped when running in reverse direction. (Bug introduced in 1.22).
Thanks to Arthur Lesuisse for reporting this.

The new option '--same-file' has been added. It allows infile and
outfile to be the same file or device.

The new option '--shift' has been added to ddrescuelog. It shifts the
positions of all the blocks in 'mapfile' by the offset
('--output-position' - '--input-position'), and writes the resulting
mapfile to standard output.

In fill mode, the location data is now written as one line without
final newline to ease finding it with simple text search tools.

Fill mode no longer requires a seekable infile. Commands like
  ddrescue -F- <(printf "BAD-SECTOR ") outfile mapfile
are now possible.

The new chapter "Meaning of ddrescue's screen output" has been added to
the manual.
